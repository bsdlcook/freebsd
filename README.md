# Preface

This repository is my current FreeBSD setup as of June 2018 to present.

# Workflow

Granted, this work-flow helps various mundane tasks less insufferable (for me personally) and much more time efficient if you know how to use it correctly; adapt the setup to your heart's content so under no circumstances am I guaranteeing this is for *you* specifically. If there's anything to improve and/or critique I'm open to suggestions, simply create a pull request or issue and I'll take a look into it when I have the time to.

*I'd like to heavily emphasize on the fact this repo contains configuration files specific to me and myself only, you'll have to manually edit them to suit your needs - by no means is this repo for other than to keep track of my setup and my setup alone.*

### Keybindings

All of the key bindings for dwm are found [here](https://gitlab.com/lcook/freebsd/blob/suckless/dwm/config.h). The default modkey is set to the Windows metakey.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Mod + j` | Focus to next client
| `Mod + k` | Focus to previous client
| `Mod + Shift + j` | Move client stack forward
| `Mod + Shift + k` | Move client stack backward
| `Mod + Enter` | Open terminal
| `Mod + Shift + prnt` | Take a screenshot
| `Mod + Shift + s` | SSH Host launcher
| `Mod + Shift + m` | FreeBSD docs launcher
| `Mod + Space` | Program launcher
| `Mod + t` | Tiling layout mode
| `Mod + f` | Floating layout mode

# Prerequisites

There isn't much prerequisites as the bootstrap script makes it *for the most part* autonomous. Before you continue running the setup you need to meet the following conditions:
- Freshly installed FreeBSD system;
- Git and doas installed ``pkg install git-lite  doas``;
- User added to the doas config file with 'nopass' enabled for that user (makes life much easier, run this command on the root account): ``echo "permit nopass YOUR_USER as root" | tee -a /usr/local/etc/doas.conf``. This isn't a good practice allowing non-privileged users running doas as root without root password. However security isn't a number one priority in this type of environment, it's simply for the sake of convenience;
- Everything else is pulled in by the setup script. Nothing else required - only a brain and common sense.

### Setup and installation

There's not much to it (given you've met the prerequisites). *Now for the fun part*:
- Clone this repo ``git clone https://gitlab.com/lcook/freebsd`` change to that given directory;
- From there you'll find a setup script that you can run by typing ``./bootstrap`` and everything else is done for you;
- The default shell is changed to fish, as well as configuration files copied to the home directory;
- There's different *phases* of the bootstrapping process that have a set of given tasks, feel free to peek into the script;
- Once these phases have completed, proceed to [suckless installation](#suckless). After installed it's suggested your reboot your computer;
- Note: the **x11-fonts/nerd-fonts** package is fairly large, give it time to download and extract (be patient).

## Suckless

As of [this commit](https://gitlab.com/lcook/freebsd/commit/cf36358c370a0ed05339924ea83afad848021890) the Suckless tools (dwm, dmenu and st) have been moved to the [suckless branch](https://gitlab.com/lcook/freebsd/tree/suckless)â€”independent of the master branch. Once you've cloned the suckless branch to another location, to install the applications, run the following:

- ``doas make clean install -C dmenu``
- ``doas make clean install -C dwm``
- ``doas make clean install -C st``
